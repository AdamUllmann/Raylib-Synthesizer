# Raylib-Synthesizer
A digital synthesizer application for personal use. The program features 6-voice polyphony with 5 different waveform oscillator types. The program also features low-pass and high-pass filters with cutoff and resonance controls. Other additions include tuning functionality, note-to-frequency mapping, and a built-in oscilloscope.

## Features:

- **Waveform Generation**: Supports multiple waveforms like sine, saw, square, triangle, and noise.
- **Frequency Control**: Play different notes using your keyboard keys.
- **Tuning**: Adjust the tuning factor to produce different frequencies.
- **Filter**: An integrated biquad filter with adjustable cutoff and resonance.
- **Oscilloscope**: Visualize the audio output.

## Controls:

- **Waveform Change**: `Shift (Left/Right)`
- **Frequency Adjustment**: `Arrow keys (Up/Down/Left/Right)`
- **Cutoff and Resonance**: Adjust using `Grave`, `1`, `Backslash`, and `Backspace`.
- **Notes**: Play notes using keys `Z` to `/`, `Q` to `=`, with black keys using `S`, `D`, `G`, `H`, `J`, `L`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `9`, `0`.
